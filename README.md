This is a page dedicated to the in-universe gambling game called Century fron Pathfinder Second Edition. The point of this project is to create a page that both holds the rules of the game and allows users to play it. It is currently in development and sorting out the layout.
Development goals:
  -Add buttons to add players which will generate the name input and upon entering will generate input fields for number selection by the players
    -Later to add a field to input their wager
  -Add functionality to check for winners and calculate payout
  -Add functionality for a vote to roll when there are multiple players
  -Make the style more appealing
  -Much later I plan on adding more games to create a playable Pathfinder casino experience
